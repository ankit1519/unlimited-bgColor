# Background Color Changer

This is a simple JavaScript project that changes the background color of a webpage every second.

## How It Works

1. When you open the `index.html` file in your web browser, you will see a webpage with a title.

2. The background color of the webpage will automatically change every second.

That's it! The project uses JavaScript's `setInterval` function to asynchronously change the background color and create a dynamic user experience.

Enjoy the continuously changing background colors!
